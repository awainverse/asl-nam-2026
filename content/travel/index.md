## Travel

### Ground Transportation

The conference location is located only a 15 minute walk from 30th Street Station (Philadelphia's main train station), making Amtrak a convenient way to get to campus from around the Northeast US.
Note that Northeast Amtrak trains tend to increase considerably in price in the few weeks before travel, so remember to book ahead.

The [{{% septa_L %}} subway](https://www.septa.org/schedules/L1) and [{{% septa_T %}} trolleys](https://www.septa.org/schedules/T) provide a quick trip into Center City, including to the Convention Center hosting the [ICM](https://www.icm2026.org/).

### Airports

- **[PHL - Philadelphia International Airport](https://www.phl.org/)**

    Philadelphia's airport is an American Airlines hub.
    The [airport train line](https://www.septa.org/schedules/AIR) connects to Penn Medicine and 30th Street Stations adjacent to the campus, as well as to Center City. The train leaves every 30 minutes, for about a 20 minute ride. For instructions, see [https://www.phl.org/getting-around/public-transportation](https://www.phl.org/getting-around/public-transportation).
    Rideshare is also convenient.

- **[EWR â€“ Newark Liberty International Airport](https://www.newarkairport.com/)**

    It is also possible to fly to EWR, one of New York City's three major airports. From EWR's train station, one can take frequent Northeast Regional Amtrak trains (about 65 minutes). See here for more information: [https://www.newarkairport.com/to-from-airport/public-transportation](https://www.newarkairport.com/to-from-airport/public-transportation). The drive is approximately 90 minutes.
